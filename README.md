This is a really basic
 proof of concept [packaged app demo](https://github.com/raoulmillais/7digital-html5-packaged-app-demo) which you can try out to see it in action.  It demonstrates using the (previously nodejs specific) javascript API client in firefoxos and chrome packaged apps.  This also works in modern firefox and chrome (and maybe others - I haven't tested) but there has been no consideration for performance or thorough testing but with some work this could be made to work well in the browser.  I used the [firefox os building blocks](http://buildingfirefoxos.com/building-blocks/action-menu.html) so the styles are pretty basic and look a bit hooky in chrome.

* To run the demo for firefox OS you'll need the firefoxos simulator.  Instructions can be found [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Firefox_OS/Using_the_App_Manager#Using_a_Firefox_OS_Simulator_Add-on)
* To run the demo as a chrome packaged app, you can find instructions [here](https://developer.chrome.com/apps/first_app#five)
